            A certificate error has occurred, likely due to the usage of self
            signed certificates in one of the clusters. Please try to visit the failed url
            and accept the CA:
            <a href={this.props.certError.failedUrl}>  {this.props.certError.failedUrl}</a>
            <div />
            The correct way to address this is to install your self CA into your browser.
            <div />
            NOTE: The contents of the resulting page may report "unauthorized".
            This is expected. After accepting the certificate, please reload the app.
            <div />
            If you think you have accepted all the certs and this issue continues to persist,
            please ensure that you have configured CORS on all relevant clusters as outlined
            in the <a href="https://github.com/fusor/mig-operator#manual-cors-cross-origin-resource-sharing-configuration">installation documentation</a>.
